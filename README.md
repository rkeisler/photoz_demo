===========
This notebook shows how to estimate the distance to a galaxy, given measurements of the optical light coming from it.  More specifically, we're going to estimate the [redshift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) of a galaxy, which is directly related to its distance, using 5-band photometry from the [Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (SDSS)](http://www.sdss.org/).
